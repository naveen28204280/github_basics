### Create a Branch (Not Needed for this exercise)

A branch is a separate line of development. It allows you to work on features or fixes without touching the main codebase until you‚Äôre ready

#### How to create a branch

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

git commit -m "add: a new feature"
```

Use clear commit messages.
